#Offline Data Collect

##About
Offline Data Collect is an Android Application designed to work with OTS Esri Services from [ArcGIS Server](http://esri.com) and [ArcGIS Online](http://arcgis.com).
It's main goal is to provide an Offline environment for traditional gps data collection workflows.  This opens the door for field data collection on commodity wifi-only Android 4+ devices.  It is built using esri's ArcGIS for Android SDK and uses much of esri's sample code.

##Background
The obvious potential for gps data collection in modern smart phones and tablets was investigated by the Montana Department of Transportation form 2011-present.  After some inital field tests during 2012, using sample esri projects and apps such as OpenDataKit and MyTracks, MDT launch a pilot project for the field collection season of 2013.

##Build
In order to build the project you need the Android SDK for API Level 14 (lowest level supported) and Esri's ArcGIS for Android SDK.  You must register with esri to download, but it is free.

Once you have the android and arcgis sdk, you may have to clean the project, or right click ArcGIS Tools > Convert to ArcGIS Android Project.

##Commit
If you want to commit to the project, please [email] (mwacker@mt.gov).

Stay tuned for more project details.

##Usage
There are plans to release to the app store once a generic usage can be setup and packages with the app.  The OnPreferencesChanged and FirstRun/initial query and setup of the services needs to be achieved.
